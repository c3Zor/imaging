    "__Deep Learning fundamentals__ - there are plenty of very deep courses on the subject. If you feel like you need to get a deeper understanding of the subject, we recommend looking for some of the Udacity courses, like the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) or some of the free resources like Stanford’s [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) and [tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/LinearRegression/). Another good resource is the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course which has been built by Jeremy Howard who has co-founded a medical imaging AI startup, Enlitic.<br>\n",
    "__PyTorch or any other specific libraries.__ If you want to get a fundamental grasp of PyTorch specifically, we recommend PyTorch’s [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) or the free [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188). We will also use NumPy quite a lot and if you need a quick intro into that, the [official tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) gives you everything you need to understand the code in this course.<br>\n",
    "__High-performance/large-scale computing on massive medical imaging datasets.__ Medical imaging datasets may become big (we are talking hundreds of gigabytes). Using them efficiently would tap into generic software architecture skills for building distributed systems, most likely using the major clouds. Every cloud provider offers a set of resources on the optimal use of their technologies. For example, you can take a look at [Microsoft’s design patterns for machine learning at scale.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/machine-learning-at-scale)<br>\n",
    "__Diagnostic medical imaging.__ While you will hopefully gain some intuition required for an understanding of radiological images and clinicians' thought process better, it takes years of medical school and residency to become proficient with using 3D medical imaging for clinical purposes.

    "## Choosing a clinical problem and framing it as a machine learning task\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have heard from a clinician about some of the opportunities in medical imaging for AI tools. You have seen some examples of medical imaging problems ripe for disruption, and you have been introduced to the concept of medical imaging modalities and the many clinical specialties that deal with medical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive deeper into many of these topics, including imaging formats and some machine learning algorithms for image processing, but for now we would like you to start thinking about clinical problems from AI engineer perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we want you to practice how to choose a clinical problem to tackle, explore how to research some basic facts about the disease, and frame the clinical problem as a machine learning task. You will not be expected to write code in this exercise. Rather, you will write a project proposal as a free form document. Don't be daunted - you are the best judge of this proposal, so write one that you think you will be able to show to a fellow clinician.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Choosing a clinical case\n",
    "\n",
    "Exciting clinical problems abound in the realm of Healthcare AI. To help you narrow down some potential ideas, we will use the American College of Radiology Data Science Institute (ACR DSI) curated list of use cases that is available by following [this link](https://www.acrdsi.org/DSI-Services/Define-AI). Alternatively, you may explore any clinical problem of your choosing without using the database if you already had something in mind. Please note that some use cases in the ACR DSI database can seem overwhelming or obscure without some background medical knowledge. If this is case, simply choose something that's more intuitive. A few good starting examples include: [Acute Appendicitis](https://www.acrdsi.org/DSI-Services/Define-AI/Use-Cases/Acute-Appendicitis), [Aging Brain - Dementia](https://www.acrdsi.org/DSI-Services/Define-AI/Use-Cases/Aging-Brain---Dementia), and [Incidental Pulmonary Nodules on CT](https://www.acrdsi.org/DSI-Services/Define-AI/Use-Cases/Incidental-Pulmonary-Nodules-on-CT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for this first part is to choose a case. If you choose to use the ACR DSI database, include **the link that points to your use case**. If using any other resources, please include an **image capture of PDF of a medical or AI journal article** that explores this problem within the context of machine learning."

We will be going over this in much more detail in further lessons of this course, but some early exposure will be useful. For example, solving the problem of autonomously detecting one or more lung nodules could be framed as an object detection task. Measuring changes in tumor volume over time may be best framed as a segmentation task, etc. Add a **short paragraph detailing how you would frame your clinical problem of choice as a machine learning task**, and explain your rationale."
