    "## Physical principles of MR scanners\n",
    "MR (magnetic resonance) scanner is arguably quite a bit more complex from the underlying computation and physics standpoint than a CT machine, and also quite a bit more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me take you through a very basic introduction into how these wonderful machines operate and produce images.\n",
    "\n",
    "[VIDEO LINK](https://youtu.be/R_erN8yoQCQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have to mention that the explanation of the MR scanner operation that I provide here is quite a bit simplified. It is sufficient for you to understand where the data is coming from and why it looks the way it does, but understanding the details of how exactly biological tissue types are localized in 3D space by the MR scanner requires more of a digression into physics and quantum mechanics than we wanted to have in this course. If you have further questions on how it all comes together, we will have links at the end of this section which will \n",

    "\n",
    "[VIDEO LINK](https://youtu.be/Tz_8uV0MIjQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "MR scanner leverages a basic physical property of protons (charged elementary particles that make up atoms) to align themselves along the vector of magnetic fields. This effect is particularly pronounced in protons that make up hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms make up water molecules, and water makes up to 50-70% of a human body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing with protons is that they possess a property called spin which could be thought of as spinning around an axis. In a normal environment, the direction of this axis is randomly distributed across different protons. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, though, the proton spins get aligned along the direction of the magnetic field, and start precessing (think of what a spinning top that’s lost some of its momentum is doing):,.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/l1-proton.gif'>\n",
    "\n",
    "When an external radiofrequency pulse is applied, of a frequency proportional to the frequency of precession, the protons respond to this pulse in unison, or resonate, and flip the orientation of their spins. Once this pulse is gone, they return to their original orientation (along the static magnetic field).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way in which protons return to their original orientation is different and depends on the tissue type that protons are a part of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since many protons are returning to their original orientation at once, they generate electrical currents in the coils that are placed nearby. Due to the resonance effect these currents are not insignificant and can be measured - these measurements constitute the data about the tissue being studied which is collected by the MRI scanner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient fields are used to vary the static magnetic field, and thus precession frequency, spatially. This allows the MR scanner to isolate a part of the body (i.e. a slice) that is being imaging. Further gradient fields are used to isolate information coming from specific locations within a slice.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-space and Reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "The currents measured by RF coils get turned into a digital format, and represented as vectors in “__K-space__”. The concept of K-space goes back to the wave theory in physics and basically defines a space of vectors that describe characteristics of electromagnetic waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, these wave vectors carry information about the characteristics of the matter in the space that has been measured. Essentially, these vectors record the spatial frequency of signal intensity, and thus, through the process that involves an Inverse Fourier Transform and a lot of de-noising and other optimizations, get turned into a familiar 2D image that represents a slice through a human body with different anatomy having different pixel intensity. This process is referred to as __image reconstruction__ in MR physics. Typically, image reconstruction is performed on a computer that is directly embedded into an MR scanner, and the problem of optimizing or scaling image reconstruction alone is a very interesting one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a CT scan, multiple slices imaged with a pre-set spatial interval through a human body are combined to obtain the 3D image. Note, however, that due to greater control over the electromagnetic fields, MR scanners can obtain data directly for a 3D volume in a single “sweep”, without having to go slice-by-slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulse Sequences\n",
    "We can vary the combination of gradient fields, RF pulses, and aspects of the signal that is getting measured. Together, these are called a __pulse sequence__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two very common sequences are called “T1-weighted” and “T2-weighted” sequences (technically - these two are looking at different aspects of the same combination of electromagnetic fields). T1 produces greater contrast resolution for fat, and T2 produces greater detail in fluids. Quite often, a contrast medium is used along with a T1 sequence to make certain structures stand out. Thus, the gadolinium agent is often used in neuroradiology to improve the visibility of things like tumors and hemorrhages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many more sequences exist, including many which are proprietary to scanner manufacturers, and there is a field of medical physics that deals exclusively with pulse sequence design.\n",

    "In this section, we took a glimpse at how MRI scanners operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, MRI scanners are probably some of the most complex inventions made by humankind. The design of one touches on hard problems in the fields of robotics, quantum physics, signal processing, mechanical, electrical, and software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRI scanners are very versatile machines that can provide great non-invasive insight into what is happening inside a human body, and they lend themselves to a lot of interesting AI problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "[VIDEO LINK](https://youtu.be/ieW5Lf0EqLw)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, __windowing__ is a fairly straightforward color mapping procedure. An interesting thing to keep in mind about windowing is that historically we have been mapping linear scales in which scanners acquire data to the linear grayscale which has the limitation of being only able to display 255 colors. People have been coming up with ideas on how to circumvent this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such idea was building special medical monitors that use more than 8 bits per single color channel or are optimized specifically for grayscale representations (e.g., look up Barco monitors that have 10- and 12-bit grayscale technology). If you think that HDR TVs are new, think again - the medical imaging industry has been building those for decades!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea would be trying to use all colors of the display or somehow optimizing the representation to fit the grayscale range better. We will post a link to some interesting experiments in this area in the next lesson, once you’ve had the chance to learn how medical images are stored.\n",

    "We just learned about __multi-planar reconstruction (MPR)__. This is where we construct 2-dimensional images in planes that are not the original acquisition plane. Typically one wants to see images in the cardinal planes - axial, coronal and sagittal, which are orthogonal to each other. Sometimes one is also interested in planes which are not orthogonal to the primary acquisition plane, and in such case we talk about oblique MPR.\n",
