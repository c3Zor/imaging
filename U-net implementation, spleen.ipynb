    "The objective of this exercise is not to train the best model ever, but rather to give you a feel for how the U-net model operates and how it can be applied to real-world datasets.\n",

    "For this exercise the data consists is one abdominal CT scan with segmentation of the spleen. There is not quite enough to train a reasonable model, however you can play with parameters and overfit your model to this particular case so that it produces a segmentation that looks good. That is what we are going to do!\n",
